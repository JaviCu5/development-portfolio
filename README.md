# Development Portfolio

This is a portfolio where I upload personal projects and code, I work it on in my spare time (which isn’t that much).
It’s a way to share my interests and give you a glimpse of how I like to work.

## Scientific
(Extra info inside) Most of the time coded in Python 3 or Jupyter Notebook.
Still a work in progress.

## Games
(Extra info inside) Mostly coded in Python 3 or Jupyter Notebook as well.
Also a work in progress.

## Java Projects
Currently empty, but I try to keep practicing so I don’t lose touch.
