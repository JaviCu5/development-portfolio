At this point, the Lotka-Volterra is the most analyzed and code developed.

## Schelling Model
Coded with Python3

**Libraries:**
- numpy
- random
- os
- matplotlib.
- PIL

**Theoretical frameworks:**  
A model based on the racial segregation in a square lattice.

## Lotka_Volterra_Model
Coded with Python, using Jupyter Notebook. (still working on it)

**Libraries**
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- scipy.signal
- random

**Theoretical frameworks:**  
Describes the interaction between two populations (prey-predator). I'm trying to guide myself through this model and its possibilities.

## Deterministic Chaos
It is just the statement to follow, anything interesting
