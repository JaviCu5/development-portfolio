System: 50x50
Occupancy: 80%
White ratio: 50%

Satisfaction: 30%

Segregation = Similar pairs/total pairs

Plot the percentage of happiness vs. the number of iterations of the system.
      Total happiness = 1/Totals * sum(happy)
Plot segregation vs. the number of iterations of the system.
      Total segregation = 1/Totals * sum(local segregation)
      Local segregation = similar pairs/total pairs

Take one of the final cmaps to visualize segregation.

Algorithm:
- With the above parameters, we create a random distribution of agents (the white and black chips are called agents)
- Calculate the happiness of the agents.
- Move an unhappy agent randomly

The simulation ends when all agents are happy or if it is clear that it will never converge (here we will have to set a maximum number of iterations, which I will invent: iter_max=10000)

Part 2
Adapt the code to:
Calculate the mean segregation and standard deviation, in each iteration, for 100 different simulations.
The same with happiness.

Change of opinion, preachers who cannot change their opinion and who find it easier to adopt opinion A than B or vice versa.
